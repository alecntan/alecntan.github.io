## Source Code
You can find the project's git repository [here](https://github.com/alecntan/snaCe).

## Requirements
If you've ever played Nokia's classic game of Snake during 1997 to the early 2000s, you could probably list down the requirements quite easily.

But if you haven't, here they are! 

- The Snake must always travel forward
- The player can change the snake's direction using directional keys
- If the snake goes out of view, the game restarts
- There must always be "food" somewhere in view
- If the snake "eats" the food: 
	-	the snake grows in length 
	- and the food is placed somewhere else
- If the snake eats itself, the game restarts

## Design

I decided to use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for the project due to the low coupling and high cohesion it provides.
This involved structuring the application into three major components - the Model, View, and Controller. 

### The Model
The model component contains the underlying data structure of the application, and the
functions that are used to manipulate them.

This meant that the model component would contain the data structures that represents
the snake and its food, as well as the functions that define the logic of the game.

Here's the header file for the Model component:
```c

#define SNAKE_SPEED		10

/// SNAKE ///
typedef struct snakeCell {
	SDL_Rect *rect;

	struct snakeCell *next;


} SnakeCell;

typedef struct snake {
	struct snakeCell *head;
	struct snakeCell *tail;

	int length;
	int next_x;
	int next_y;

	int dirVector[2];
	int vectorLength;
} Snake;


Snake *create_snake(int initPosX, int initPosY);

void destroy_snake(Snake *snake);

void move_snake(Snake *snake);

void change_dir(Snake *snake, int x_dir, int y_dir);

void grow_snake(Snake *snake);

int pos_y(Snake *snake);

int pos_x(Snake *snake);

int hit_itself(Snake *snake);

int is_hit_wall(Snake *snake);


/// FOOD ///
typedee SDL_Rect Food;

Food *create_food(void);

void change_food_pos(Food *food, Snake *snake);

void destroy_food(Food *food);
```

### The View
The view component is responsible for rendering the relevant data structures into
whatever representation we want. It takes the current instance of the snake and food 
defined in the model component, and displays their current state into the current window.
Several functions that are used to manipulate the view are also defined here.

I decided to use SDL library for the graphical aspect of the game, mostly becuase it was written in C. You can find it [here](https://www.libsdl.org/).

Here's the header file of the View component:
```c
#ifndef CELL_CONSTS
#define CELL_WIDTH 	   20
#define CELL_HEIGHT    20
#define RECT_HEIGHT    20
#define RECT_WIDTH     20
#define WINDOW_WIDTH   640
#define WINDOW_HEIGHT  480

#define SNAKE_WIDTH	20
#define SNAKE_HEIGHT 20

#define FOOD_WIDTH 5
#define FOOD_HEIGHT 5

#endif


// Forward declarations
typedef struct snake Snake;
typedef SDL_Rect Food;


typedef struct view {

	SDL_Window *window;
	SDL_Renderer *renderer;

}View;

View *init_view(void);

void draw_snake(View *view, Snake *snake);

void update_view(View *view, Snake *snake, Food *food);

void draw_food(View *view, Food *food);

```

### The Controller
The Controller is the bridge between the user and the Model component, and defines
how the user can manipulate the state of the game.

In here you'll find the "main loop" of the game, which listens for keyboard events
using the SDL library. It also uses the functions provided by the Model and View components to manipulate the game state in response to the keyboard events.

Here's controller.c:
```c
int main(void){

	Snake *snake = create_snake(320, 350);
	View *view = init_view();
	Food *food = create_food();

	draw_snake(view, snake);
	draw_food(view, food);

	SDL_Event event;
	int playing = 1;
	while(playing) {
		while(SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
			if(event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN) {
				SDL_Keycode keycode = event.key.keysym.sym;
				if(keycode == SDLK_ESCAPE) {
					playing = 0;
					break;
				} else if(keycode == SDLK_UP) {
					change_dir(snake, 0, -1 );
				} else if(keycode == SDLK_DOWN) {
					change_dir(snake, 0, 1);
				} else if(keycode == SDLK_RIGHT) {
					change_dir(snake, 1, 0);
				} else if(keycode == SDLK_LEFT) {
					change_dir(snake, -1, 0);
				} else if(keycode == SDLK_q) {
					SDL_Quit();
					return 0;
				} else if(keycode == SDLK_r) {
					destroy_snake(snake);
					snake = create_snake(320, 350);
					draw_snake(view, snake);
				}
			} else if(event.type == SDL_WINDOWEVENT) {
				if(event.window.event == SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE){
					SDL_Quit();
					return 0;
				}
			}
		}


		move_snake(snake);
		update_view(view, snake, food);
		SDL_Delay(50);

		int curr_y = pos_y(snake);
		int curr_x = pos_x(snake);

	  if( is_hit_wall(snake) || hit_itself(snake) ){
			destroy_snake(snake);
			destroy_food(food);
			snake = create_snake(320, 350);
			food = create_food();
			draw_snake(view, snake);
			draw_food(view, food);
		}
	}

	return 0;
}

```
