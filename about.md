Hello! I’m Alec Tan.

I’m a software engineering student at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia. I have a passion for solving problems, and helping people, through code. 

My coding journey began when I was given a book on programming at the age of 11 years old. I enjoyed seeing the computer complete its appointed task all by itself, and how much you can accomplish through code. This enjoyment then lead me to pursue software engineering after high school. 

Now at University, my passion for software has only continued to grow. Learning more about the software industry, and being exposed to technologies that I didn't even know existed, has made me more eager to further develop my skills and grow as an engineer. Since then, I've participated in whatever opporutnities I could find. I've competed in one of Amazon’s coding competitions called “Amazalgo”, and in a 24 hour Hackathon hosted by UNSW’s Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSESoc).

In my spare time, I love [reading]({% link _posts/reading_list/2021-10-17-reading-list.md %}) about new technologies and applying them in some interesting [projects]({% link projects.html %}) of my own. I'm currently reading Leonard Richardson's "RESTful Web APIs: Services for a Changing World", with the goal of building my own REST API in the future.

Currently, I am seeking internship positions in software engineering, and I would love to be part of a team where I can further expand my knowledge and experience, and help people along the way.

Outside of programming I love reading books, drinking coffee, and binging on Netflix.

## Technologies I'm Currently Using
- Python
- Flask
- C
- Git
