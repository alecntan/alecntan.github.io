Hello! I'm Alec Tan.

I'm a software engineering student at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia. I have a passion for solving problems, and helping people, through code.
I'm always eager to further develop my skills and grow as an engineer, and so I would often have a book in hand - I'm currently reading Leonard Richardson's "RESTful Web APIs: Services for a Changing World". You can find my reading list in here.

My coding journey began when I was given a book on python programming at the age of 11 years old. I enjoyed seeing the computer complete its appointed task all by itself, and seeing how much you can accomplish through code.
This enjoyment then lead me to study software engineering at university where I learned about software design, best development practices, and how to use technologies that I didn't even know existed. Since then 
I participated in whatever opportunity I could find - I competed in one of Amazon's coding competitions called "Amazalgo", and I even participated in a 24 hour Hackathon hosted by UNSW's Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSESoc).
In my spare time, I like to work on my own projects, and apply what I've learned from university and from my own learning. You can find my projects in [here]({% link projects.html %}). 

Currently, I am seeking internship positions in software engineering, and I would love to be part of a team where I can further expand my knowledge and experience, and help people along the way. 

Outside of programming I love reading books, drinking coffee, and watching Anime.


## Technologies I'm Currently Using
- Python
- Flask
- HTML & CSS
- Git
