Hello! I’m Alec Tan.

I’m a software engineering student at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia. I have a passion for solving problems, and creating cool things, through code. 

My coding journey began when I was given a book on programming at the age of 11 years old. I enjoyed seeing the computer complete its appointed task all by itself, and seeing how much you can accomplish through code. This enjoyment then lead me to pursue software engineering after high school. 

Now at University, my passion for software has only continued to grow. Learning more about software design and development, and being exposed to some amazing technologies that I didn't even know existed, has made me more eager to further develop my skills and grow as an engineer. Since then, I've participated in whatever opportunities I could find. I've competed in one of Amazon’s coding competitions called “Amazalgo”, and in a 24 hour Hackathon hosted by UNSW’s Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSESoc).

In my spare time, I love [reading]({% link _posts/reading_list/2021-10-17-reading-list.md %}) about new technologies and applying them in some interesting [projects]({% link projects.html %}) of my own. Currently, I am reading “Computer Science Distilled: Learn the Art of Solving Computational Problems” by Wladston Filho.

Currently, I am seeking intern positions related to software engineering. I would love to be part of a team where I can further expand my knowledge and experience, and help work on some interesting projects along the way.

Outside of programming I love reading books, drinking coffee, and binging on Netflix.

## Technologies I'm Currently Using
