I'm a software engineering student at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia. I love solving problems through code, especially if it helps make people's lives better in some way. 
I also love to learn and so I always have a book in hand - currently I'm reading Leonard Richardson's "RESTful Web APIs: Services for a Changing World". You can find my reading list in here.

My coding journey began when I was given a book on python programming at 11 years old. I enjoyed seeing the computer complete its appointed task all by itself, and seeing how much you can do through code.
This enjoyment then carried me to studying software engineering at university, where I was exposed to a wide array of technologies that I did not know existed. Since then I participated in whatever opportunity
I could find - I competed in one of Amazon's coding competitions called "Amazalgo", and I even participated in a 24 hour Hackathon hosted by UNSW's Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSESoc).
In my spare time, I like to work on my own projects, and apply what I've learned from university and from my own learning. You can find my projects in [here]({% link projects.html %}). 

Currently, I am seeking internship positions in software engineering, and I would love to be part of a team where I can further expand my knowledge and experience, and help people along the way. 

Outside of programming I love reading books, drinking coffee, and watching Anime.
